## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The specific packages used in this project mainly are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, catboost and xgboost for the purposes of data cleaning and manipulation, data visualization and modeling respectively.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Starbucks Open Data to better understand:

1. Can we predict which users are more or less likely to complete a bogo or discount offer?
2. What is the best model for performing this prediction and how high can we get our out of sample f1 score?
3. What features are most impactful in driving whether or not an offer will be completed?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ryanvogt7/starbucks-capstone-project-2af2219b2dea).
